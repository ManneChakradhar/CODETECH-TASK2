# Customer Segmentation Analysis Using k-Means Clustering
Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing the customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways which are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits. The customer segmentation technique depends on several key differentiators that divide customers into groups to be targeted. Data related to demographics, geography, economic status, and behavioural patterns are crucial in determining the company's direction towards addressing the various segments.
This project focuses on performing Customer Segment Analysis using unsupervised learning techniques on a given dataset. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behaviour, demographics, and other relevant features. This analysis helps in understanding customer preferences and targeting marketing efforts more effectively.

# Overview
While using the k-means clustering algorithm, the first step is to indicate the number of clusters (k) that we wish to produce in the final output. The algorithm starts by selecting k objects from the dataset randomly that will serve as the initial centres for our clusters. These selected objects are the cluster means, also known as centroids. Then, the remaining objects have an assignment of the closest centroid. This centroid is defined by the Euclidean Distance present between the object and the cluster mean. We refer to this step as “cluster assignment”. When the assignment is complete, the algorithm proceeds to calculate the new mean value of each cluster present in the data. After the recalculation of the centres, the observations are checked if they are closer to a different cluster. Using the updated cluster mean, the objects undergo reassignment. This goes on repeatedly through several iterations until the cluster assignments stop altering. The clusters that are present in the current iteration are the same as the ones obtained in the previous iteration.
